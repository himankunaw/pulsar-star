# pulsar-star
## Overview

HTRU2 is a data set which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the
High Time Resolution Universe Survey (South) . 
	
Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on
Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-
stellar medium, and states of matter . 
	
As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses
our line of sight, produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. As pulsars
rotate rapidly, this pattern repeats periodically. Thus pulsar search involves looking
for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes.
	
	
Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to
facilitate rapid analysis. Classification systems in particular are being widely adopted,
which treat the candidate data sets  as binary classification problems.
Here the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples
the majority negative class. At present multi-class labels are unavailable, given the
costs associated with data annotation.
